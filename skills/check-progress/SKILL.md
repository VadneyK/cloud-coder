# Check Progress

Monitor the status of running Cloud Coder task queues and audit-fix loops.

## Quick Status Check

```bash
# Is the runner still going?
ps aux | grep -E "run-local-overnight|audit-fix-loop|claude" | grep -v grep

# How many tasks completed?
cat devops/cloud-coder/logs/completed.txt 2>/dev/null | sort -u | wc -l

# Latest runner output
tail -30 /tmp/overnight-*.log 2>/dev/null

# Latest loop output
tail -30 /tmp/audit-fix-loop.log 2>/dev/null

# Latest audit score
grep -r "OVERALL_SCORE" backend/docs/prod-readiness-audit-*.md 2>/dev/null | tail -1
```

## Report to the user:
1. Runner status - running or finished
2. Tasks completed - count of unique IDs in completed.txt
3. Current task - most recently started task (from runner log)
4. Failures - any tasks that exited non-zero
5. Score progression - if audit loop is running, show score history across rounds
