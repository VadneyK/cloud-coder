  Run a continuous audit-fix-audit loop that scores a codebase and automatically
    fixes gaps until a target score is reached. Use when the user asks to
      "get us to 10/10", "keep improving until perfect", "run a continuous improvement
        loop", "audit and fix automatically", or wants an autonomous cycle of
          scoring, generating fix tasks, executing them, and re-scoring.

            # Audit-Fix Loop

            Set up and run a self-sustaining loop that audits a codebase, generates fix tasks for remaining gaps, executes them, and re-audits until the target score is reached.

            ## How It Works

            Each round:
            1. **Wait** - polls for any running overnight runner to finish
            2. **Audit** - Claude CLI audits the codebase, writes a report, outputs `OVERALL_SCORE=X.X`
            3. **Check** - if score >= target (default 10.0), exit success
            4. **Generate** - Claude CLI reads the audit, creates a task queue for remaining gaps
            5. **Fix** - the overnight runner executes all tasks
            6. **Repeat** from step 1

            ## Starting the Loop

            ```bash
            nohup bash devops/cloud-coder/audit-fix-loop.sh > /tmp/audit-fix-loop.log 2>&1 &
            ```

            ## Audit Dimensions

            The audit scores 7 dimensions (1-10 each):
            Security, Reliability, Observability, Testing, Infrastructure, Code Quality, Compliance

            ## Key Design Decisions

            - Uses claude-sonnet-4-6 for audits and queue generation (fast, cheap)
            - Score comparison uses `awk` to avoid bash integer arithmetic issues with decimals
            - Each round writes a separate audit file for historical tracking
            - The runner runs in foreground within the loop so it blocks until complete
