  Create and run an autonomous overnight task queue. Use when the user asks to
    "run tasks overnight", "queue up work", "create an overnight queue",
      "batch these tasks", "run this while I sleep", or wants to execute a list
        of coding tasks sequentially using the local Claude CLI without supervision.

          # Run Queue

          Set up and execute a YAML task queue using the local Claude CLI. Each task runs sequentially, commits to the target branch, and logs output. Completed tasks are tracked so re-runs skip finished work.

          ## Queue File Format

          Create a YAML file with this structure:

          ```yaml
          version: "1"
          tasks:
            - id: unique-kebab-case-id
                priority: P0
                    repo: backend
                        estimated_minutes: 20
                            prompt: |
                                  Detailed instructions for Claude. Include:
                                        - Exact file paths to modify
                                              - What to change and why
                                                    - How to test (test commands)
                                                          - Commit message to use
                                                          ```

                                                          ## Running the Queue

                                                          ```bash
                                                          nohup bash devops/cloud-coder/run-local-overnight.sh devops/cloud-coder/overnight-queue.yaml > /tmp/overnight.log 2>&1 &
                                                          ```

                                                          ## Key Rules

                                                          - Always use `< /dev/null` on claude invocations to prevent stdin consumption
                                                          - Do NOT use `set -e` in the runner (non-zero exits should not kill the loop)
                                                          - Tasks run sequentially to avoid merge conflicts
                                                          - Completed task IDs persist in `logs/completed.txt` for idempotent reruns
